# Emulatrix
Emulatrix is a programming challenge that requires many levels of programming proficiency: disassembly, scripting, assembly, and others. 

The executable, `Emulatrix`, emulates a quirky architecture used to secure the lock of Dr. Foobar's dungeon. It looks for a 256-byte file `prog` which it emulates upon being executed. Your task is to disassemble the emulator, work out the kinks of the architecture, then write a `prog` file which cracks the lock. The lock will be cracked if "Cracked successfully in `n` cycles" is printed.
